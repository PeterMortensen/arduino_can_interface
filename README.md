=====================

 board: Adafruit Perma-Proto Half-sized Breadboard PCB (http://www.adafruit.com/products/571)

 Since there's no place on the board to hold the ATmega only a pin row is used.
 CANH and CANL are also only on a pin row and not on a D-Sub connector.

 ATmega32u4 + MCP2515 + MCP2551
